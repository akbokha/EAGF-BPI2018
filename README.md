#### Business Process Intelligence Challenge 2018
*Mining the EAGFâ€™s Application Process of EU DirectPayments for Farmers* :ear_of_rice::chart_with_upwards_trend:

Several processes are analysed in relation to- and in the context of- the Business Process Intelligence Challenge 2018. The processes that are analysed, describe the application processes for EU direct payments from the European Agricultural Guarantee Fund (EAGF). These applications are, for example, for subsidies that are facilitated to farmers. This guarantees a lower bound income for the aforementioned farmers that is decoupled from the production levels that is achieved by them. These processes are, in relation to a set of business questions, analysed and described using various process- and data-mining techniques and tools.
